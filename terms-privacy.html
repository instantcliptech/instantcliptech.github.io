         <p>INSTANTCLIP reserves the right to amend these Conditions of Use to adapt them to the legislation in force at any given time. In addition to these General Conditions of Use, certain services in the App, due to their specific characteristics, may also
             be subject to their own specific conditions of use (hereinafter, the “Specific Conditions”). The Company may, at any time and without prior notice, make changes and updates to these Conditions of Use. </p>

         <p>These changes shall be published in the App and shall apply as of the time they are published. As a result, the User should regularly check to see if any changes have been made in these Conditions of Use and, regardless of whether or not express
             consent is required, by continuing to use the Service after the changes have been published, the User agrees to and accepts such changes. In the event that the User does not agree to the updates in the Conditions of Use, he/she may revoke the
             consent given by ceasing to use the Service.</p>

         <h2>USER STATUS</h2>

         <p>Downloading and accessing the App is free of charge, except for the cost of the connection to the telecommunications network supplied by the service provider contracted by the User. The party who downloads and uses the App is granted user status
             (hereinafter, the “User”), which involves reading, understanding and accepting all the terms and conditions stipulated herein. </p>

         <h2>USER LICENSE</h2>

         <p>INSTANTCLIP grants the User a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable personal limited license on the App for personal, private, non-commercial use thereof, limited in all cases to the terms described in these Conditions of Use. This license shall
             be restricted to the period set forth in these Conditions of Use and shall be subject to the territorial availability of the App. Notwithstanding the above, INSTANTCLIP can rescind or revoke this license at any time.</p>

         <p>The user license described above grants the User the possibility to create short personal videos (or “stories”) using the User’s own recordings, photographs or other images, adding music and other sounds provided by the User or furnished through
             the App, if so desired. All of the above shall take place under the conditions set forth herein. </p>

         <p>No other rights shall be construed as being granted to the User under this license beyond the use of the App under the terms established herein.</p>

         <h2>USE OF THE MOBILE APP AND ITS SERVICES</h2>

         <p>The User acknowledges and agrees that the contents and/or services offered in this mobile App shall be used exclusively at his/her own risk and/or liability. The User agrees to use this mobile App and all its contents and Services in accordance
             with any applicable legislation, ethical principles and the public order, as well as complying with these Conditions of Use and any Specific Conditions that may, in each case, apply. The User also agrees to use the Services and/or contents of
             the mobile App in an appropriate manner and to refrain from using them to perform illicit activities or actions that constitute a crime, that infringe or violate the rights of third parties and/or that violate intellectual or industrial property
             regulations or any other applicable rules of the legal order. </p>

         <p>Use of the App shall be limited to the User's private and personal sphere and, specifically, use of the App for commercial purposes is prohibited unless the User owns the copyright or has obtained the relevant rights or licenses to use all the images,
             audiovisual work, music, sound recordings, voiceovers and other materials included in the video created by the User for such purposes (hereinafter, the “User Content”).</p>

         <p>The User expressly warrants that the User Content and, in general, the videos contained in said content, do not violate any laws or infringe any third-party rights, including Intellectual Property Rights and other privacy rights, among others. If
             the User uses the App for commercial purposes of any kind and/or such party’s User Content contains material that is protected by a copyright not owned by the User, such party warrants that he/she has obtained all the rights, licenses, consent
             and permissions required to use said material protected by copyright in relation to the creation and/or publication of said User Content through the App. In this regard, the User is expressly informed that song fragments or other audio or sound
             bites that could be provided by third parties through the App shall be protected by copyright, and therefore the User can only use them for private purposes, never for commercial purposes. </p>

         <p>INSTANTCLIP shall not be held liable, nor does it accept any liability, for the User Content or the videos that any User may create with the App. INSTANTCLIP does not access or store the User Contents or their videos and therefore, has no control over
             them. The User shall be the sole party liable for the User Content and the videos generated, as well as for the purposes for which the User uses them, including the consequences of sharing or publishing them by any means and over any website or
             social network, including, but not limited to, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, Snapchat, WhatsApp, etc. INSTANTCLIP has no control over third-party websites or platforms, so any User who shares his/her videos in any such media does so for his/her
             own account and risk.</p>

         <p>In addition, by way of illustration but without limitation or exclusion of any kind, the User also agrees: - To refrain from duplicating, reproducing, selling, leasing, renting, licensing, distributing or by any other means using the App (and/or
             its software) for any purpose other than that expressly authorized in these Conditions of Use. - To refrain from decompiling, modifying, reformatting, translating, performing reverse engineering, disassembling or by any other means accessing the
             source code. - To refrain from using the App to transmit, install or publish any kind of virus, malware or other damaging programs or files. - To refrain from using the App or creating videos for illicit purposes or to share, transmit or provide
             to third parties any kind of information, element or content that violates fundamental rights or infringes third-party rights of any kind.</p>

         <p>The User shall be liable for any action that infringes or breaches the terms set forth in these Conditions of Use or any legal provisions that may apply, and accepts any and all liability deriving from his/her use of the App and the videos generated,
             as well as for any negligence or breach of these Conditions of Use, including any consequential loss and/or loss of profits that could derive from such party's actions. </p>

         <h2>PAID SERVICES</h2>

         <p>You may be able to make in-App purchases, in which case the fee is collected via Apple (for iOS) and Google (for Android) (our “Billing Service Providers”). We may also offer subscriptions, which can also be paid for via Apple and Google.</p>

         <p>Certain subscription offerings may include a free trial prior to charging your payment method. If you decide to unsubscribe from such a subscription before the Company starts charging your payment method, you must cancel the subscription before the free trial ends. Otherwise, you will be responsible for payment for the full term of the subscription period.</p>

         <p>INSTANTCLIP does not guarantee availability of access at all times or functional continuity of this mobile App and its services, nor does it warrant that it is free of errors. As such, INSTANTCLIP shall not be held liable, within the limits set forth

             for the correct use of the online services provided by INSTANTCLIP. Downloading, access and use of the App on mobile or similar devices does not entail an obligation by INSTANTCLIP to monitor for the presence of viruses, worms or any other harmful
             IT components. The User shall, in all cases, be responsible for ensuring that proper tools are in place to detect and disinfect harmful software.</p>

         <p>Furthermore, INSTANTCLIP cannot guarantee that the Users of this mobile App will use the contents and/or services herein in a diligent manner without infringing third-party rights and in accordance with the law, ethical principles, the public order,
             these General Conditions of Use and, where applicable, the relevant Specific Conditions. INSTANTCLIP shall not be held directly or vicariously liable for loss and damage of any kind deriving from the use made of the App by the Users. Therefore,
             use of this App does not entail an obligation by INSTANTCLIP to verify the truthfulness, accuracy, appropriateness, suitability, thoroughness or topicality of the information furnished through it. INSTANTCLIP shall not be liable for decisions made
             on the basis of the information provided through the App or for loss or damage incurred by the User or third parties as a result of actions based solely on the information obtained through the App.</p>

             others that are not specifically mentioned herein, accepting no liability whatsoever in this regard. Should the law in any jurisdiction restrict or prohibit the above-mentioned transfer of liability of implicit or any other type of guarantees
             described above, the transfer or limitation of liability described above shall apply in the broadest manner allowed by the law in such jurisdiction, provided it is applicable to these Conditions of Use.</p>
